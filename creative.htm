                            We replaced a smile with a curt nod,<br>
                            That was quite flawed.<br>
                            Then a hug with a handshake,<br>
                            That seemed quite fake.<br>
                            Next was peace with pace,<br>
                            That is when we turned life into a race.<br>
                            From a personal connect to a digital one,<br>
                            Oh! Can‚Äôt you see it should not be done?<br>
                            What will we replace next I wonder,<br>
                            Without letting our conscience stir.<br>
                            Warmth of a mother‚Äôs lap or loyalty of a dog,<br>
                            What‚Äôs next on the catalogue?<br>
                            Could we replace love or loyalty by convenience?<br>
                            Whoever gave us that licence?<br>
                            What is life without emotions and feelings?<br>
                            Without them can we even be called human-beings?<br>
                            Loyalty is like a fragrance,<br>
                            Not to be replace by mere convenience.<br>
                            Dogs, they are man‚Äôs best friend,<br>
                            On machines you can never depend.<br>
                            So if you ask my opinion,<br>
                            Such a replacement can never be forgiven.<br>

                            January 2030. Who could have thought that in a short span of 10 years, the Earthlings would
                            have colonised Mars. It had just happened. After years of speculation, theories,
                            astronomical investments and advancements to find life somewhere else on the galaxy, the
                            Life had finally found us. January 2020 Earth had been attacked.<br>
                            The word chaos had found another meaning. The Ministry of Magic had lost no time in deciding
                            that the time had come. An intervention was needed and the Muggles could no longer be
                            trusted to run the planet. Where for centuries every little humble cosmological
                            accomplishment by the Muggles had been publicized, celebrated and cherished, within a matter
                            of days, the astronomical advancement was at a different level. Not only had our immediate
                            neighbour Mars been zeroed in as our new home but an entirely new infrastructure had been
                            created and the baffled Muggles had been teleported there. Simultaneous preparations had
                            been made to defend the beautiful blue planet from its invaders. The invaders were strong
                            and hostile but with the Wizards in charge there were chances of success. Amid speculations
                            of how and why, the Muggles had adjusted well to the new life that had to been given to
                            them. Though the Muggles were not the brightest or the most enterprising of the lot but they
                            certainly were the most adjusting. From homes to a communal living, from lavish cuisines and
                            variety of drinks to daily dose of pills, from breathing in oxygen to recycling
                            carbon-di-oxide, everything had changed. The Earthlings had made all the adjustments and
                            allowances not only socially and physiologically but also biologically to make Mars their
                            new home. The Wizards and the Muggles of Earth had united. Everyone was happy to be safe and
                            alive. All was well‚Ä¶or was it?<br>
                            Deep down the curst of the Red Planet the Martians were making their own plans.
