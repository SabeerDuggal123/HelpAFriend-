                            <h2>Cyber-Security</h2>
                            Cyber-security is the practice of protection of hardware and software to ensure there is no
                            misuse
                            or information. With the growing use of computers and smartphones for the purpose of
                            education
                            cyber-security has become a real issue with the children. In this year of COVID-19. Most
                            children
                            have experienced it in some form or the other even when it is seemingly harmless like
                            strangers
                            entering the Zoom classrooms and causing disruption. However, it can have serious
                            repercussions
                            too
                            and hence it is important to educate our children to ensure they are adequately
                            protected.<br>
