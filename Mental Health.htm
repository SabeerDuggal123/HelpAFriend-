        Mental Health means our emotional, psychological and social health. Till recently, we concentrated only on our
        physical health and greatly ignored mental health. However mental health is important at all times and in all
        stages of life.<br>During these COVID-19 times we are all locked in and isolated which can affect our mood,
        thinking and behavior.
        If you are experiencing any such changes in mood, thinking or behavior do not panic. They might be manifested in
        various ways like:<br>
        
        <!--Unordered list-->
        <ul class = "leftfloater">
            <li>Eating disorders</li>
            <li>Having low energy levels</li>
            <li>Feeling sad, helpless and hopeless</li>
            <li>Not wanting to do anything or participate in usual activities</li>
            <li>Wanting to stay alone and away from people</li>
            <li>Feeling irritable and upset</li>
        </ul>
        The good news is that you are not alone. It is only normal.

        However, saying that it is normal does not mean you do ignore these signs. It means that you need not panic and
        just concentrate on talking positive actions like:
        <!--Ordered list-->
        <ol class = "leftfloater">
            <li>Staying Positive</li>
            <li>Talking about your situation with parents, teachers or school counsellors</li>
            <li>Getting professional help if needed</li>
        </ol>

        <u>Remember, you are NOT alone!</u>
