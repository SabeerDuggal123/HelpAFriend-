                            Physical health encompasses both a healthy body and a healthy mind. There are two important
                            components that can help ensure a healthy body â€“ physical activity and diet. Hence to ensure
                            that we keep ourselves at our healthy best physically we need to focus on the following:<br>
                            <ul type="square">
                                <li>
                                    <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
                                    Physical activity is very important to ensure that our body stays in best condition,
                                    reduces the risk of disease and gives us energy and positivity. Yoga is an old and
                                    effective way of exercise. It tones our body without undue pressure to our bones and
                                    other body parts. It is proven to provide best results when done consistently over a
                                    period of time. However, we need to ensure that we have learnt how to do the asanas
                                    well
                                    before we attempt them since if done improperly it can lead to more harm than good.
                                    You
                                    should try to get atleast 30 minutes of exercise daily.<br>

                                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                                    A good diet is an important part of physical health. We should ensure that our diet
                                    is
                                    balanced and adequate. Over-eating or binging of anything is very harmful hence
                                    portion
                                    control is very important. There is a growing trend these days to eat junk food,
                                    especially amongst the younger generation. Such food does not provide the necessary
                                    nutrients and minerals and often leads to the problem of over-weight which leads to
                                    diseases like diabetes and hypertension.<br>

                                    <h2>Healthy mind</h2>
                                    A healthy mind is just as important for our physical health as a healthy body.
                                    Mental
                                    well-being can be enhanced by various ways the most commonly practiced being
                                    meditation.
                                    Meditation is about mindfulness. It is the practice of training your mind to focus
                                    on a
                                    particular object and clearing away all other thoughts and activities. It gives you
                                    mental clarity and makes you emotionally calm. Regular meditation ensures a healthy
                                    mind
                                    free of stress and diseases like depression.<br>
